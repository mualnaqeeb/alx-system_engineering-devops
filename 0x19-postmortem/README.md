# Postmortem: The Great Database Outage of 2023

## Issue Summary

On November 3rd, 2023, from 14:00 to 15:30 PST, our main product service experienced a significant outage impacting approximately 40% of our active user base. Users experienced intermittent errors and exceedingly slow response times during this period. The root cause was determined to be a misconfiguration in our primary database load balancer.

## Timeline

* **14:00 PST** - Issue detected by our automated monitoring systems, which triggered alerts to the engineering team.
* **14:05 PST** - Initial investigation by the on-call engineer indicated that the problem was related to the database layer.
* **14:20 PST** - The issue escalated to the database team.
* **14:30 PST** - False lead pursued, initially believing the problem to be related to a recent software update.
* **14:45 PST** - Database team discovered that the issue stemmed from a misconfiguration in the database load balancer.
* **15:00 PST** - Steps taken to rectify the misconfiguration and restore services.
* **15:30 PST** - Full service resumed.

## Root Cause and Resolution

The issue was caused by an unintended change in the configuration of our primary database load balancer during a routine maintenance window. This change led to uneven distribution of traffic, overwhelming certain database nodes while leaving others underutilized.

Resolution involved correcting the misconfiguration, redistributing the traffic evenly across all database nodes. Following this, services gradually returned to normal as the load balancer properly distributed incoming queries.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures

This incident highlighted two main areas for improvement:

* **Change management procedures** - The error occurred during a routine maintenance operation, indicating a need for improved oversight and checks during these processes.
* **Automated configuration validation** - An automated check could have caught this misconfiguration before it impacted the live service.

To address these issues, we propose the following tasks:

1. **Review and enhance our change management procedures** - Introduce mandatory peer reviews and automated checks for all changes to critical infrastructure configurations.
2. **Implement automated configuration validation for critical systems** - Develop and deploy a system that can automatically detect and alert on configuration changes, preventing issues from reaching production.
3. **Improve load balancer monitoring** - Enhance monitoring to alert on uneven traffic distribution across database nodes.

By implementing these measures, we aim to prevent similar incidents in the future and ensure a high quality of service for our users. We appreciate your understanding and patience as we continue to improve our systems.
